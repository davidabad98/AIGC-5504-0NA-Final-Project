    """
    Perform an inverse transformation on the processed synthetic data to recover the original feature space.

    This function splits the synthetic data into numerical and categorical parts based on the
    preprocessor configuration, applies the individual inverse transformations, and then
    concatenates the results into a single DataFrame with the original column order.

    Args:
        preprocessor: A fitted ChurnDataPreprocessor instance with attributes:
            - preprocessor: The ColumnTransformer used for transformation.
            - numerical_features: List of names of numerical features.
            - categorical_features: List of names of categorical features.
            - original_feature_order: The original order of the features before transformation.
        X_transformed (np.ndarray): The synthetic data in the processed feature space.

    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: DataFrame containing the data in the original feature space.
